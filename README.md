## Bioinformatics Toolkit: A Curated Collection for Modern Biological Data Analysis

This repository is a comprehensive suite of bioinformatics tools, scripts, and pipelines designed for the end-to-end processing and analysis of high-throughput biological data. It serves as both a practical resource for conducting research and an educational reference for common bioinformatics workflows.

The collection features robust, modular pipelines for key analytical tasks, including:

* Sequence Alignment & Processing: Efficient workflows for mapping next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads (e.g., from DNA-Seq, RNA-Seq) to reference genomes using state-of-the-art aligners, followed by processing and manipulation of SAM/BAM files.

* Transcriptomics: Complete pipelines for RNA-Seq analysis, from quality control of raw FASTQ files with tools like FastQC and MultiQC, to differential gene expression analysis, alternative splicing detection, and functional enrichment using packages like DESeq2 and clusterProfiler.

* Phylogenetics: Scripts for constructing evolutionary trees, including multiple sequence alignment, model testing, and tree inference using maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods, with visualization for publication-ready figures.

* Data Visualization: A dedicated set of scripts for creating insightful, customizable visualizations in R (ggplot2) and Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for genomics data, such as genome browser tracks, volcano plots, heatmaps, and principal component analysis (PCA) plots.

Primarily implemented in R, the code emphasizes reproducibility, clarity, and scalability. Each module is documented with example usage and required dependencies, making it easier to integrate into larger projects or for those learning bioinformatics programming.
