# Title - Tracking the Evolution of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) Gene Across Species
# Project Objective
** Investigated the evolutionary conservation of the HBB gene across six species. This includes sequence retrieval, alignment, logo generation, and phylogenetic tree construction. 
# Project Tasks
## Sequence Retrieval & BLAST Search  
  ** Used BLAST to identify HBB sequences from at least 5 other species, such as chimpanzee, cow, mouse, chicken, and zebrafish. 
  ** Downloaded the FASTA format of these sequences and created a simple table that shows: Species name, Accession number, and % identity with human HBB 
## Pairwise Sequence Alignment 
  ** Performed pairwise alignments of Human HBB vs Closely Related Species (Chimpanzee) and Human HBB vs Distantly Related Species (Zebrafish) using a EMBOSS Needle 
  ** Reported for each comparison: % Identity, % Similarity, and Number of gaps 
## Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) 
  ** Performed a Multiple Sequence Alignment of all 6 sequences using Clustal Omega   
  ** Highlighted the highly conserved regions. 
## Sequence Logo Generation 
  ** Uploaded the MSA file to Skylign. 
  ** Generated a sequence logo to visualize conserved amino acids. 
## Phylogenetic Tree Construction 
  ** Used the MSA to generate a phylogenetic tree using MEGA X.
