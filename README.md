# Title - Tracking the Evolution of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) Gene Across Species
# Project Objective
## Using the skills I learned in Module 2, I investigated the evolutionary conservation of the HBB gene across six species. This includes sequence retrieval, alignment, logo generation, and phylogenetic tree construction.
